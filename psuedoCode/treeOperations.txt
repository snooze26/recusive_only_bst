add the tree instance to the class
    create tree as a constrctor and set the class's tree as the constructor tree

    if currentNode node is null return new Node with value as its input 
    return the currentNode if value and currentNode's data are equal 
    run the function recursviely left with the value and left node if the value is less than the node's data
    run the function recursively right with the value and right node if value is more than the node's data 
    after if statements return the current node 
}

        if there is no left node then return the right Node
        if there is no right node then return the left node 
        assign the rootNode data to the min of the right subtree 
        assign the right node to the function recursively ran with right node and node's data as the inputs
