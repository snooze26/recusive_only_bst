create a class and name it tree 
tree has array as a constructor 
properties: 
    class's array is equal to array 
    class's root is buildTree function with inputs of 
        array: array, start: 0, end: array.length -1 

*********************
buildTree(array) {
    if start is greater than end then return null 
    mid will be equal to start + end / 2 rounded 
    root will be the inputed array with mid as its index 
    create the left subtree using the method recrusively 
    create the right subtree using the method recursively 
    return root 
 }
